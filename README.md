# 🚀 Autonomous-Documentation

**Autonomous-Documentation** is a repository developed as part of a **summer internship** at Consulteer in **Portugal**, during **July and August 2025**.

The main goal of this internship is to explore and compare different **AI-powered tools for automatic code documentation**, evaluating their effectiveness, integration capabilities, and overall usefulness in real-world development environments.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project is organized into **separate branches**, each dedicated to a specific tool:

- `docuwriter-ai`
- `mintlify`
- `document360`
- `patched`

Each branch contains experiments, examples, and evaluations of how the tool performs in generating technical documentation.

## 🧠 Tools Evaluated

### 🛠️ DocuWriter.ai
An AI-powered tool that generates technical documentation directly from source code. It also supports test generation, code refactoring, and language translation. Especially useful for API references and legacy codebases.

### 🎨 Mintlify
A modern, developer-focused documentation platform that creates interactive and customizable documentation sites. It uses AI for writing assistance, content suggestions, and semantic search, with strong Git and CI/CD integration.

### 📚 Document360
A comprehensive knowledge base platform for internal and external documentation. It offers version control, collaboration tools, analytics, and a conversational AI assistant ("Ask Eddy AI"). Designed for both technical and non-technical users.

### 🧩 Patched
An open-source Python framework for building custom AI automation workflows. It allows users to define "Patchflows" that connect to LLMs, analyze code, and interact with GitHub. Highly flexible and customizable.

## 🎯 Internship Goals

- Evaluate the quality of documentation generated by each tool.
- Measure the impact on developer productivity.
- Explore integration with version control and CI/CD pipelines.
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases for each solution.

## 📊 Methodology

Each tool is tested using the same codebase. Evaluation criteria include:

- Clarity and completeness of the generated documentation
- Ease of setup and use
- Integration with Git and CI/CD
- Multi-language support
- Additional features (e.g., test generation, refactoring)
